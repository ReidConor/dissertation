SLIDE 1: THE ART AND SCIENCE OF CAUSE AND EFFECT
<BR>
</h3>
<font size=4> 
OPENING STATEMENT
</a>
<BR>
<td align=top>  
<P>
<font size=+1> 
Thank you Chancellor Young, colleagues, and members of 
the Senate Selection Committee for inviting me to deliver
the eighty-first lecture in the UCLA Faculty Research 
Lectureship Program. 

It is a great honor to be deemed worthy of this 
podium, and to be given the opportunity to share my research 
with such a diverse and distinguished audience. </P>

<P>The topic of this lecture is causality - 
namely, our awareness of what causes what in the world
and why it matters. 

Though it is basic to human thought, Causality is 
a notion shrouded in mystery, controversy, and caution, 
because scientists and philosophers have had difficulties 
defining when one event TRULY CAUSES another.

We all understand that the rooster's crow does
not cause the sun to rise, but even this simple fact
cannot  easily be translated into a mathematical equation.</P>
</td>

Today, I would like to share with you a set of ideas which I
have found very useful in studying phenomena of this  kind.
These ideas have led to practical tools that I hope 
you will find useful on your next encounter
with a cause and effect.</P>

<P>And it is hard to imagine anyone here who is NOT dealing 
with cause and effect. 

Whether you are evaluating the impact 
of bilingual education programs or running an experiment on 
how mice distinguish food from danger 
or speculating about why Julius Caesar crossed the Rubicon or 
diagnosing a patient 
or predicting who will win the 1996 presidential 
election, you are dealing with a tangled web of cause-effect considerations.

The story that I am about to tell is aimed at helping 
researchers  deal with the complexities
of such considerations, and to clarify their meaning.

SLIDE 2: OUTLINE
</h3>
</a>
<td align=top>  
<font size=+1>
This lecture is divided into three parts.

I begin with a brief 
historical sketch of the difficulties that various disciplines 
have had with causation. 

Next I outline the ideas
that reduce or eliminate several of these historical 
difficulties.

Finally, in honor of my 
engineering background, I will show how 
these ideas lead to simple practical tools, 
which will be demonstrated in the areas of
statistics and social science.

<h3>
SLIDE 3:  ADAM AND EVE (DURER)
</h3>
</a>
<td align=top>  
<font size=+1>
In the beginning, as far as we can tell,
causality was not problematic. 

The urge to ask WHY and the 
capacity to find causal 
explanations came very early in human development. 

The bible, for example, tells us that
just a few hours after tasting from the tree of knowledge,
Adam is already an expert in causal arguments.

When God asks: "Did you eat from that tree?"

This is what Adam replies:
        "The woman whom you gave to be with me, 
        She handed me the fruit from the tree; 
        and I ate."

Eve is just as skillful: 
        "The serpent deceived me, and I ate."  </P>
</table>
The thing to notice about this story is
that God did not ask for explanation, only for the facts:
It was Adam who felt the need to explain - the message is clear,
causal explanation is a man-made concept.

Another interesting point about the story: explanations 
are used exclusively for passing responsibilities.  

Indeed, for thousands of years explanations had no other 
function.  Therefore, only Gods, people
and animals could  cause things to happen, not objects,
events or physical processes.

SLIDE 4:  THE FLIGHT OF LOT (DORE) 
</h3>
</a>
<td align=top>  
<font size=+1>
Natural events entered into causal explanations 
much later, because, in the ancient world, events
were simply PREDETERMINED.

Storms and earthquakes were CONTROLLED by the angry gods,
and could not, in themselves, assume causal 
responsibility for the consequences.

SLIDE 6:  ON BOATS AND WHALES 
</h3>
</a>
<td align=top>  
<font size=+1>
One such message gave the prophet Jonah the scare of his life 
when he was identified as God's renegade and was thrown OVERBOARD.

Quoting from the book of Jonah:  
"And the sailors said: `Come and let us cast lots to find out 
who is to blame for this ordeal.' So they cast lots and the lot fell on Jonah." 

Obviously, on this luxury Phoenician cruiser, "casting Lots" were
not used for recreation, but for communication - a one-way 
modem for processing messages of vital importance.</P>
<P>
In summary, the agents of causal forces 
in the ancient world were either deities, who cause things 
to happen for a purpose, or human beings and animals, 
who possess free will, for which they 
are punished and rewarded.

This notion of causation was naive, but clear and unproblematic.  

The problems began, as usual, with engineering; when machines
had to be constructed to do useful jobs.

SLIDE 8:  "... AND I WILL MOVE THE EARTH" (VAVIGNON, 1687)</a>

SLIDE 9:  EARTH MOVING MACHINE (DELMEDIGO, 1629)</a>
<BR>
</h3>
<td align=top>
<font size=+1>
Systems consisting of many
pulleys and wheels, one driving another, were needed
for projects of such magnitude.

And, once people started building multi-stage systems,
an interesting thing happened to causality - PHYSICAL 
OBJECTS BEGAN ACQUIRING CAUSAL CHARACTER\.

When a system like that broke down, it was futile
to blame God or the operator - instead,
a broken rope or a rusty pulley  were more
useful explanations, simply because those
could be replaced easily, and make the system work.

At that point in history, Gods and humans 
ceased to be the sole agents of causal 
forces - lifeless objects and processes
became partners in responsibility.

A wheel turned and stopped BECAUSE the wheel 
proceeding it turned
and stopped - the human operator became secondary. </P>
</table>
Not surprisingly, these new agents of causation TOOK ON
some of the characteristics of their predecessors -
Gods and humans.  

Natural objects became not only 
carriers of credit and blame, but also carriers of
force, will, and even purpose.

Aristotle regarded explanation in terms of a PURPOSE
to be the only complete and satisfactory explanation for why a 
thing is what it is. He even called it a "FINAL CAUSE",
namely, the final aim of scientific inquiry. </P>

<P>From that point on, causality served a dual role:
CAUSES were the targets of credit and blame on one
hand, and the carriers of physical flow of control on the other.

What happened can be seen on the title page of Recordes' book "The
Castle of Knowledge," the first science book in English, 
published in 1575.

The wheel of fortune is turned, not by the wisdom of 
God, but by the ignorance of man.

And, as the role of God, the final cause, was taken
over by human knowledge, the whole notion of causal explanation 
came under attack.

Most of us know Galileo as the man who was brought before

But while all that was going on,
Galileo also managed to quietly engineer the most profound 
revolution that science has ever known.

Ask how well you can predict the time

and how that time will vary from object to object, 
and as the angle of the track changes.

Moreover, said Galileo, do not attempt to answer such 
questions in the qualitative and
slippery nuances of human language; say it
in the form of mathematical equations.

SLIDE 17:  GALILEAN EQUATION <I>d=t<sup>2</sup></I>

<td align=top>
<font size=+1>
It is hard for us to appreciate today how strange that  idea
sounded in 1638, barely 50 years after the introduction 
of algebraic notation by Vieta.
To proclaim algebra the UNIVERSAL language of
science, would sound today like proclaiming Esperanto the language of economics.

Why would Nature agree to speak Algebra? of all languages? 

But you can't argue with success.

The distance traveled by an object turned out
indeed to be proportional to the square of the
time.

</h3>
<td align=top>
<font size=+1>
Even more successful than predicting outcomes of experiments
were the computational aspects of algebraic equations.

They enabled engineers, for the first time in history, 
to ask "how to" questions, in addition to "what if"
questions. 

In addition to asking: 
"What if we narrow the beam, will it carry the load?"

They began to ask more difficult questions: 
"How to shape the beam so that it WILL carry the load?" 

This was made possible by the availability 
of methods for solving equations.       

The algebraic machinery does not discriminate among variables;
instead of predicting behavior in terms of parameters, we can
turn things around and solve for 
the parameters, in terms of the desired behavior. </P>

<P>Let us concentrate now
on Galileo's first maxim, "description first explanation second", 
because that idea was taken very seriously
by the scientists, and changed the character of 
science from speculative to empirical.

Philosophers, however, were reluctant to give up the idea
