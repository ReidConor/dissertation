\section{Introduction}\label{S.intro3}
{This literature review first presents an introduction into some of the ways that corporate success can be measured. This includes how M\&M defined corporate success as well as other considerations that may prove useful in this study. This is followed by an analysis of literature pertaining to the relationship between corporate governance and company performance, again including M\&M's research as well as other relevant studies. This review finishes with an exploration of how one can move towards inferring causality from relationships found in data, and the issues that arise in attempting to do so. }
