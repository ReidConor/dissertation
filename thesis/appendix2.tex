\chapter{Program code}\label{C.Appendix2}
All code written in the fulfilment of this project is available at \url{https://github.com/ReidConor/dissertation}. Contained in that repository are all scripts and files used to preprocess the various datasets involved, run the numerous algorithms and finally compile the results. Note that this code frequently interacts with a local instance of MySQL for data control and preservation purposes. The code required to establish this infrastructure is not included. The various files that make up this document are stored there also.
