Go over methods of variable selection - PCA

Read back over akelleh and make sure I know what its doing

Meet with James, re-evaluate tasks

Subset variables down to those listed in appendix A

rerun mm replication to see if the above improves things
	- it doesnt
	- better off including everything in terms of numbers
	- but less model complexity by subsetting

take a cut of variables that are important in the class / reg stage
+ and use them in the causal stage
