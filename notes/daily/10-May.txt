Regularised Regression
---
What I need to do is
	build a load of regression models
	that vary along alpha (which is the penalty term in the regression)
	and vary along lambda (which decides how features are handled, induces lasso / ridge or a combo - elastic net)

So vary alpha between 0-1 in intervals of 0.1
So vary lambda between 0-1 in intervals of 0.1 
...and pick the one that minimises the MSE and maximises the R squared value
