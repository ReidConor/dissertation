Dear Dr. Moldovan, Dr. Mutu,

My name is Conor Reid, I am a graduate student in the UCD Michael Smurfit Graduate Business School, Dublin, Ireland. I am studying for an MSc in Business Analytics, and in the coming months will be undertaking a research project. I am planning to extend the research outlined in "Learning the Relationship Between Corporate Governance and Company Performance Using Data Mining" of your authorship, and am wondering if you are willing to share the data you collected during this study?

I plan to reproduce some of the findings of the above paper, and introduce alternative (and potentially useful) features of governance and performance. I am also in the process of studying modern work in proving causality, with a view to applying it in this domain. This is in an effort to further validate the findings outlined in your paper, and contribute to the field by doing so.

I am of course willing to cite your research as the inspiration for my own, and credit you with the collection of the dataset. I plan to submit a paper to the Machine Learning and Data Mining in Pattern Recognition conference next year, subject to the success of the above goals.  

I am contactable on this email address, as are my mentors who are cc'd on this email.

Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely, 
Conor Reid
