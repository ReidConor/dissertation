From "Beyond prediction: Using big data for policy problems":
	How am I going to tbe able to get causality? Seems like domian knowledge will be important to have. Need to read through some tutorials etc on this area.

Contact the authors as soon as possible? Want to know if I can have their data or not, since I'll need to get going on bloomberg asap if I can have theirs. Maybe need bloomberg anyway?
