Summary
*****************
see https://github.com/akelleh/causality
allows for causal analysis using observational data (rather than experimental) 


Details
*****************
use the CausalDataFrame object (which is an extension of a pandas DataFrame)
two methods; 
	first is the zmean method. this allows you to control for a set of variables, z, when youâ€™re trying to esteem the effect of a discrete variable x on a continuous variable y. supports both returning the y estimates as each x, as well as providing bootstrap error bars.
	second is plotting to show the effect of discrete or continuous x on continuous y while controlling for z. this is done using the zplot method.
only algorithm currently implemented is IC* by Pearl (2000) [this is in my lit review]
