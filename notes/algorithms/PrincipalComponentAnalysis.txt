Principal Component Analysis
-----------
Statistical procedure to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components
designed such that the first component accounts for as much of the variability in the data as possible
each successive one has the highest variable possible under the constraint that it is orthogonal (ie perpendicular in vector space) to the preceding components 
the resulting vectors are an uncorrelated orthogonal basis set
it is sensitive to the relative scaling of the original variables

> 1. Introduction 
PCA provides a approximation of a data table / matrix, X in terms of the product of two small matrices T and P`
T and P` capture the essential data patterns of X
plotting the columns of T gives a picture of the dominant "object patterns"
plotting the rows of P` shows the complementary "variable patterns"
pca originally aimed to find "lines and planes of closest fit to systems of points in space"
pca is not the same (although is similar to) factor analysis (fa)


> 2. Problem Definition for Multivariate Data
data matrix / table denoted by X
N rows are referred to as objects (ie the samples etc) 
K columns are termed "variables" or measurements made on the objects 
some of the goals of pca are
	data reduction 
	variable selection 
	outlier detection




> 9. Data Pre-Treatment
as pca is a least squares method, outliers severely influence the model
so you need to remove them, using "initial PC plots)
also, making the data matrix more centrally distributed is a good thing
scaling should also be done
variables with large variances have large loadings in PCA, which is a type of bias
be careful with variables with very little variance though
if that variation is noise rather than signal, then that noise will be amplified and have a greater influence
in terms of missing values, you can either guess a value or use a PC algo that can handle missing values
