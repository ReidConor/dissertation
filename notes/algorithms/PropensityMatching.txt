Propensity score matching
-----------
used for statistical analysis of observational data
technique that attempts to estimate the effect of a treatment by accounting for the covariates that predict receiving the treatment
attempts to reduce the bias due to confounding variables
instead of simply comparing those who received the treatment and those who didn't
implements the rubbing casual model for observational studies

you control for confounders, because the apparent different in outcome between the treated and control groups may depend on characteristics that affected whether or not a unit received a given treatment instead of due to the effect of the treatment
in randomised experiments, the randomisation enables unbiased estimation of treatment effects 
for each covariate, randomisation implies that treatment groups will be balanced on average 
but for observational studies, the assignment of treatments to research subjects is not typically random 
matching attempts to mimic randomisation by creating a sample of units that received the treatment that is comparable on all observed covariates to a sample of units that did not receive the treatment

psm is for cases of causal inference and selection bias in non-experimental settings in which 
	few units in the non-treatment / treatment are comparable
	selecting a subset of units is difficult due to high dimensionality 

in normal matching we match on a single characteristic that distinguishes the treatment and control groups 
but if the groups do not have substantial overlap, then substantial error may be introduced 
psm employs a predicted probability of group membership based on observed predictors, usually obtained from logistic regression to create a counterfactual group
propensity scores may be used for matching or as covariates 


a propensity score is the probability of a unit being assigned to a particular treatment given a set of observed covariates 
propensity scores are used to reduce selection bias by equating groups based on these covariates 


Advantages / Disadvantages
psm estimates an average treatment effect from observational data
it balances treatment and control groups on a large number of covariates without losing a large number of observations

only accounts for observed (and observable) covariates 
that is, factors that affect assignment to treatment and outcome but that cannot be observed cannot be accounted for in the matching procedure
any hidden bias due to latent variables may remain after matching 

also requires large samples with substantial overlap between treatment and control groups 




Rubin causal model
-----------
implemented by propensity matching
its an approach to the statistical analysis of case of effect based on the framework of potential outcomes 
been extended into a general framework for thinking about causation in both observational and experimental studies
