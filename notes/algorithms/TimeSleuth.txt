Summary
*****************
http://timesleuth-rule.sourceforge.net
used for generating temporal rules from sequential data
implements the TIMERS algo and can judge the causality or acausality (think this means not causal) of the rules it generates


High-Level Details
*****************
allows C4.5 to understand the progression of time among variables
judges the causality or acausality of temporal relations 
unsupervised investigation of relationships among attributes
converts decisions rules into Prolog statements
screens output rule based on confidence level 
tabular presentation of the output for analysis 
acts as a gui for C4.5 
for details see https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1004/1004.3334.pdf


More Detail
*****************
used for learning rules form observed data 
test the causality of the rules
data mining (human interpreted) as well as machine learning (use automatically) tool
output Prolog statements (1)
built on top of C4.5 (which is used in MM study)
time here can flow forward or backwards, facilitating the user to investigate the nature of relationships among variables







1. Prolog
*****************
stands for Programming in Logic
its a language well suited to logic and AI programming

input is something like father(peter, conor) -> Peter is the father of Conor
then at prompt -> father(peter, conor) results in “yes/true”
rules based system
