Findings
----

Fincl..l mean is higher in eep
medians and quartiles are similar
thus more extreme values in eep



Sust.Gr.Rt median in spx way higher (~ 10 vs 5.5)
its the maximum rate of growth that a firm can sustain without having to expand financial leverage  
so eebp has to take on leverage to achieve the same growth
