Notes on the Simple Logistic Algorithm Implementation
-----------
The original algorithm is from Weka
I can’t install RWeka properly (would need some serious time to fix I reckon)
Thus, use Caret
That is, us the train() function with method=LMT (which stands for Logistic Model Trees)
See https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/caret/versions/5.16-24/topics/train
See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46572275/the-train-function-in-r-caret-package 
The issue is, that you can’t have nulls in the independent variables 
We have lots of nulls, such that we can’t just ignore them
So what do?
	impute 
	replace with mean / median
	encode as zero, then construct another predictor thats one if its missing / zero if not. always include both in any analysis

mice (for imputation) isn’t removing all the nulls
see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20947908/imputation-mice-in-r-still-na-left-in-dataset
appro this could be because there is a high level of collinearity (one predictor can be predicted from the other)
threshold=1 should remove this issue…but doesn’t
so..use threshold=1 to remove a lot of them then remove all the records that have nulls
