> recursive partitioning: Recursive partitioning creates a decision tree that strives to correctly classify members of the population by splitting it into sub-populations based on several dichotomous (completely different) independent variables

> heterogeneous: diverse in character or content.

**Notes

tl;dr - you need to provide a treatment variable. does this fit with my analysis?

casualTree function which implements the methods from recursive partitioning for heterogeneous causal effects
also the casualForest and propensityForest functions which implements versions of the casual forces algorithm from estimation and inference of heterogeneous treatment effects using random forests

the causalTree function builds a regression model and returns an rpart object 
causalTree builds a binary regression tree model in two stages 
but focuses on estimating hetrogeneous treatment effects 
the function requires the user to specify a binary treatment variable in addition to the outcome variable and the features that are usually passed to rpart
