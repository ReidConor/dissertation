Notes on the method used by M&M
---

two dependent variables, tobins Q ratio and the altman z score
three stock indexes, s&p 500, stoxx europe 600 and stoxx eastern europe 300

during preprocessing, they removed all records where there were missing values on the attribute of the dependent variables or did not have enough information to calculate their values. 
also removed outliers to eliminate possible data errors

they discretised q score to get two classes based on median value

divide altman z into three classes, according to definitions provided by altman himself. 
	[for spx and sxxp]
	above 2.99 = safe
	below 2.99, above 1.81 = grey 
	below 1.81 = distress 
	
	[for emerging markets]
	above 2.6 = safe
	below 2.6, above 1.1 = grey 
	below 1.1 = distress

resulted in 
	spx - 496 	[down from 500, 99.2%] 
	sxxp - 595	[down from 600, 99.1%]
	eebp - 297 	[down from 300, 99%]
