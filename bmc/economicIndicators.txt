**The Primacy of GDP
main measure of economic activity 
8% annual growth (world GDP)
uses America as a case study, since its the highest GDP in the world 
gap calc is still a wip
eg Italy including black market which increased it overnight
just because they are official and numerical doesn't mean they are accurate
governments from time to time change the scope 
key economic indicators
	> economic growth
	gdp is the market value of all final goods/services produced in a country
	broader indicator of activity 
	gdp = c + i + g + (x-y)
		c = personal consumption
		i = private investment
		g = government consumption
		x = exports
		y = imports
	breakdown of the above varies from country to country 	
	USA is consumer driven, that is its c is 69.2% of gdp 
	its also a net importer since its x-y = -3.6%
	China spending a lot on infrastructure, so large i
	Denmark has large social safety net, thus large g
	note that if imports go up, gdp goes down as per the formula 
	that makes sense, since youre buying imports and not producing anything to comp
	cant look at dollar amount change in gdp (nominal), because of inflation 
	need to look at real change, which will be lower due to inflation 
	nominal gdp growth (%) - inflation (%) = real gdp growth (%)
	a recession is defined as two successive quarters of negative real gdp growth 
	
	indicators of the health of the economy
	> inflation
	erodes the value of bonds
	inflation means a unit of money tomorrow buys less than a unit of money buys today
	inflation is the cause of the raise in cost of living 
	two sources of inflation data - gdp report and consumer price index
	

	> unemployment
	consumer spending is almost entirely driven by salaries
	economy shrinks when more people get fired than hired
	increase in unemployment depresses gdp growth 
	positive correlation between gdp growth and employment


	> business confidence
	individual business leaders make much bigger decisions than individual consumers
	business people make large investment and hire people if they are confident there will 
	+be demand for their goods and services in the future
	eg ism index / pmi (purchasing manager index)
	correlation between gdp growth and pmi index
		


	> housing
	accounts for 3% of us gdp 
	but..when people buy new houses that triggers a lot more spending on other consumer goods
	so it actually accounts for a lot more
	for there to be new houses, builders need to have confidence that people will take a 30 year mortgage on it



	real gdp growth is the main gauge of economic health 
	economic growth is cyclical, with a series of booms and busts
	investors interpret the economy through economic indicators 
	leading indicators attract the most investor interest


**Monitoring GDP
gdp estimation by governments is a time consuming periodic activity 
gdp arrives too late to be useful to investors
instead, investors glean gdp growth through related indicators
the indicators that are released first attract the most attention 


**Forecasting GDP
analyst forecasting info available in terminal 
eg you can see how the estimates of pmi etc are calculated by analyst + real results 
so you can see the pmi estimate, real figure, then drill down and see how its calculated 
analysts maintain estimates of what key indicators will be in the short term
they also form opinions on longer term future for the most important economic statistics
analyst publish forecasts on key economic indicators
long term economic estimates are foundational to financial models
changes in estimates illustrate economic optimism and pessimism. significant changes in estimates may herald an economic turning point
investors compile many indicators, rather than one, to predict turning points




**ket takeaways
1. real gdp growth is the main measure of an economy 
2. more timely indicators offer the most insight to investors
3. indicators can foretell turning points in the economy 
	in some interpretation of these indicators can lead to profitable trading opportunity
